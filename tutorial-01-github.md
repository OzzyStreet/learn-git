# Tutorial 01 - setting up on github

## Forking
Most tutorials have you start with an empty repository.
in this tutorial we will start with a pre-populated reqpository in order to better simulate real-life scenarios

1. go to the [learn-git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/aviadr1/learn-git/)
2. fork the repository \[[help](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)\]
